This is a habit tracker for myself. I notice the feelings of
concentration and satisfaction are similar. And I like these feelings.

Rule is simple: doing it for consecutive 21 days then change the item
from TODO to DONE. Let's see how many DONE I can done.

Any time broken, re-start it from zero. Try to find why I broke on
that day. Is there anything I can do to prevent it happen again? Or
should I change the rule to be more practical or more precise?

* TODO Habit A: no distractive Internet
** rules
*** AA [too hard]
   - no youtube/b*
   - no bbs
   - no blogs

Exceptions are:

   - need to quick solve a programming related questions
   - life emergency
   - planed on agenda

Goal is to focus on the time block that it is supposed to do.

Instead of fully blocking the access to Internet, I try to:
- assign a 20-min section after the morning section to go through
  those distractive webs
- assign a long time block each week at a fix time to do the Internet

*** AB
open computer then check-in to the tasks.
- morning
- afternoon
- evening

  If, morning and afternoon done nicely. Then 20 minutes Internet
  without stress before evening.

     the lunch.
   - [X] Day 02 Not a day start with computer, so cross it.
     Next day, try check it after dinner.

   - [X] Day 03 Today, I did browser some of these websites; but I did
         after I finished the task in that block. So, I revise the
         rules. If I can finish this Habit, maybe I can try a more
         restricted Habit tracker challenge.
   - [X] Day 04
   - [ ] Day 05 fail; when check a tech blog, start to read unnecessary
         pages.
** ideas
*** CANCELLED elisp
- write a function:

  For a special task, if check in, after a given time period, using
  bufferfly as a reminder.

  Just use a physical timer.

* TODO Habit B: self reflection
** rules
   review my day in Emacs
   - day
   - week (not yet implement, need to design procedure and test it
     once finished this habit)
** ideas
   BA: review my day in Emacs include every weekly review

  - [X] Day 08 I think there's a reason why I am still be able to hold
    Habit B. This habit takes significantly less amount of energy to
    do it. Just one keyboard stroke, then I am in the flow.

    Whereas, H-a, I need to constantly remind myself not doing
    something. And that is hard. It turns out it's more easy to do
    something rather than not to do something.

  - [X] Day 09 H-a is still too hard for me. Let me break it down to
    even more simple action. As the rule-AA write

  - [X] Day 10 when doing cpu, allocate sometime to "ZK" materials
    into my brain

  - [X] Day 11 I don't feel good about open browser during the small
    break. That's where the trouble really comes. Block the access
    again and to see what will happen

  - [X] Day 12 For habit-AB

    Procedure is easy:

    1. After [habit I have], I will [habit I need]
    2. After [habit I need], I will [habit I want]

    After I start my day with [checking in with agenda in the morning], I
    will [checking in with agenda in the afternoon]

    After [checking in with agenda in the afternoon], I will watch
    [youtube] after the work out.
