This is a habit tracker for myself.

Rules: doing it for consecutive 21 days then change it from TODO to
DONE.

Any time broken, re-start it from zero.

It was tracked on my org-agenda with `habit` module on.

* TODO Habit A: no distractive Internet
** rules
   - no youtube/b*
   - no bbs
   - no blogs

Exceptions are:

   - need to quick solve a programming related questions
   - life emergency
   - planed on agenda

Goal is to focus on the time block that it is supposed to do.

Instead of completing blocking the access to Internet, I try to:
- assign a 20-min section after the morning section to go through
  those
- assign a long time block each week at a fix time to do the Internet

         after I finished the task in that block. So, I revise the
         rules. If I can finish this Habit, maybe I can try a more
         restricted Habit tracker challenge.
